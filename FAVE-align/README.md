## Installation

### Dependencies

FAVE-align depends on **HTK** and **SoX** to work. 
As such, you'll need to have these installed.

As HTK requires modification of its source code to work properly, it is *strongly encouraged* that you refer to the GitHub wiki page on the topic (https://github.com/JoFrhwld/FAVE/wiki/HTK-3.4.1) even if you feel confident in what you're doing.

Otherwise the GitHub wiki contains the relevant documentation for the installation and configuration of HTK and SoX.
