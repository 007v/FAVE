## Installation

### Dependencies

FAVE-align depends on **[HTK](http://htk.eng.cam.ac.uk/)** and **[SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/)** to work. 
As such, you'll need to have these installed.

As HTK requires modification of its source code to work properly, it is *strongly encouraged* that you refer to the GitHub wiki page on the topic (https://github.com/JoFrhwld/FAVE/wiki/HTK-3.4.1) even if you feel confident in what you're doing.

Otherwise [the FAVE GitHub wiki](https://github.com/JoFrhwld/FAVE/wiki) contains the relevant documentation for the installation and configuration of HTK and SoX.
