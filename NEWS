==========

Features
--------

* FAVE-align is now compatible with Windows

Bugfixes
---------

* stop words are now logged correctly when using a custom stop words file. `opts.stopWords` takes the place of global `stopWords` everywhere
* case for both the preceding and following word transcriptions is now correctly changed before the measurement is recorded
* `pickle` files are written in binary mode to avoid issues with imported classes
* FAVE-align now only uses the file extension when checking that wav and txt input files are the correct type, instead of redundantly verifying both the extension and a MIME type that was guessed from the extension
* invalid or missing segments adjacent to the vowel that is being measured are now recorded as `''` (empty string) rather than `NA`, for consistency

Compatibility
-------------

* FAVE-align now uses `os` and `shutil` module functions instead of OS-specific shell commands
* FAVE-extract now uses `splitlines()` instead of stripping `\n` when parsing multiple input files or a stopwords file
